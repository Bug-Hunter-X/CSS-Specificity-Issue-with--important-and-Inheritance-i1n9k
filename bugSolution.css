The solution avoids using `!important` and utilizes a more effective approach to manage the specificity conflict:

```css
.parent {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.child {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.child p {
  font-size: 18px;
}
```

By removing `!important` from `.child`, the more specific selector `.child p` correctly overrides the `font-size` of its parent. This approach is clearer, more maintainable, and prevents unexpected behavior caused by `!important`.
